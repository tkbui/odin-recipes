TheOdinProject - HTML practice (planning to revisit in the future to spruce it up with CSS).

This project will be a basic recipe website, built from TheOdinProject's HTML lessons thus far (e.g. setting up HTML boilerplate, using core HTML elements and attributes for displaying text, links, and images).
